# Impact of Objective Control on Team Win Chances in Dota 2

## What is Dota 2?

Dota 2 is a competitive video game in the MOBA grenre (multiplayer online battle arena). As a MOBA, it features two teams of five players each, and both teams are attempting to push down the map in order to destroy the other team's base.

The image above shows the two sides of the maps that both teams start and spawn in (named Radiant and Dire). I try to keep the color's consistant in the graphs below.

The main focus of this project details the impact of the following objectives on win chances for a given team:
* First Blood
* Gold
* Roshan

# First Blood

First blood, as the name implies, is the first kill of the game. Every kill awards gold in Dota 2, but first blood awards an additional 135 gold on top of the normal gold you receive. For perspective, the normal gold ammount awarded for a kill follows this formula:
```120 + (killed hero level Ã— 8) + streak value```
