** EC2 Instances
	* TMUX (keeps things running even when you disconnect)
	* tmux attach (command to attach process)
	* ctrl-b-d ?
	* T2 large? instance (should be $60 a month if running 24/7)
	

* HYPOTHESIS TESTING AND GRAPHS
* BAYESIAN TESTING??

* do NOT do a time series based dataset
	* anything economic is usually time series
	* stock opening and closing is a time series
* do NOT do a summerized dataset
* ideally a kaggle dataset?
* high metrics for a trusted data source (lots of people use it)

* lots of graphs
	* organized
	* not too simple, not too busy
	* LABELS AND TITLES
	* Land has a github repo with good graph/bad graph examples
	* ^this is in studyhall in slack
* lots of a/b testing

* need a readme on github for 3 or so dataset ideas
* by end of thursday, proposals need to be done

* 2 things:
	1) idea generation
	2) competent programming
		- do a LOT of programming
* use git, use it frequently, use it rigerrously

* capstone presentation is only 5 minutes
* you're presenting to a non-technical audience (even if it's pretending)
* needs to be froma github readme file
* maybe 10 good graphs seems to be the standard
* work backwards from the presentation
	* what few questions do I want to answer?
	* what questions did they ask?
	* exploration is key
* try out different technologies
	* seaborn?
	* do stuff you were bad at
	* do graphs that are hard
	* LINEAR REGRESSION
		* Risiduals
		* QQ plot
* meeting every day as groups, once in the morning, once in the evening
